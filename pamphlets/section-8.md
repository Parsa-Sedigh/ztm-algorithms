# Section 8: 08 - Data Structures Linked Lists

## 88-001 Linked Lists Introduction
What problem did we encounter with arrays?

With static arrays, we only had a certain amount of data or memory that can be allocated next to each other in memory. But then both dynamic and static arrays can
increase their memory once it hits a certain limit and double up that memory in another location. But that operation, every once in a while of doubling up the
array in order to create more memory, had a performance implication and it cost us O(n) . Additionally, arrays also had bad performance for any sort of operations like
insert and delete that had to shift indexes over, especially when you inserted or deleted any item that wasn't the end of the array.

Hash tables solve some of the problems of array but they weren't ordered. How can we solve this problem? Linked lists!

There are trade offs when it comes to data structures!
