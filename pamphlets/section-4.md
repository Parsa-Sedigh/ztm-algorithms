## 56-008 Optional Exercise Google Interview On Your Own
Now that you have a better idea of the steps you need to follow to succeed in a coding interview, I recommend you do the below exercise:

1. Try and go through the 15 steps on your own and answer the same question as in the Google Interview in your own language by yourself or in 
front of a friend (or a fellow student on Discord). Share your code with everyone in our private Discord community in the #interview-questions channel.

2. Rewatch the Google interview video and notice how you understand the steps a lot better now. Don't worry though, by the end of this course, I am going
to show you this video one last time and you will see how it will all make sense and become second nature to you even more!

Once done, keep going to the next video :)
